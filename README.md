# restobar
Educational open-source project destined towards learning to consume REST APIs

Restobar's main purpose is to serve as a tool for web development trainees to understand how REST API's work, how to make them as intuitive as possible, and how they fit in current web applications. It does so by providing a straight-forward domain for a restaurant with various meals, beverages and people with tastes according to their personalities.

During the tutorial, the user will be able to retrieve meals, figure how they're "built", and make their own to satisfy the customers.

Restobar is made with Java 1.8 EE, connecting to MySql Workbench with Hibernate, and providing a REST API through the Spark Framework.
